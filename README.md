[![CI](https://github.com/CodeShayk/generative-ai-dotnet-samples/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/CodeShayk/generative-ai-dotnet-samples/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Runnable code samples for **Generative AI in .NET** by Najaf A. Shaikh.

Every sample in this repo corresponds to a section of the printed book. The full book-to-code map lives in [`docs/citation-index.md`](docs/citation-index.md). When the book condenses a section in favor of pointing here, the manuscript cites a **tag** (e.g. `v1.0-first-print`) so the cited code matches the print run -- `master` will drift as the surrounding APIs evolve.

> **About this code.** These are **teaching samples**, not production-grade libraries. They are written for clarity over coverage: each sample demonstrates a single technique, with error handling, retry, observability, and configuration shown to a useful depth rather than exhaustively. Patterns covered -- prompt caching, resilience, evaluation, model routing, output guards, MCP transports -- are real and copy-pasteable, but hardening, threat-modeling, and cost-bounding them for your environment is your responsibility.

## Prerequisites

- **.NET 9 SDK** (`dotnet --version` should be 9.0.x).
- **Provider credentials** for samples that hit a live model -- each sample's README names exactly which it needs:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI / GitHub Models samples.
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` + `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` for Azure OpenAI samples.
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude samples.
- **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** for the offline samples and any sample that lists Ollama as its default profile.

The repo uses **central package management** -- versions live in [`Directory.Packages.props`](Directory.Packages.props), shared MSBuild properties in [`samples/Directory.Build.props`](samples/Directory.Build.props). Project files only carry `<PackageReference Include="..." />` -- no version attributes.

## Configuration and secrets

All samples read configuration in the standard .NET cascade: `appsettings.json` -> `appsettings.Development.json` -> environment variables -> User Secrets. **No sample contains a hardcoded API key.** Where User Secrets are required, the sample's README spells out the exact `dotnet user-secrets set` commands.

For local development, prefer User Secrets:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets init --project samples/ch01-foundations/01.3-hello-chat
dotnet user-secrets set "OpenAI:ApiKey" "<your-key>" --project samples/ch01-foundations/01.3-hello-chat
```

For anything beyond a developer workstation -- CI, shared environments, deployed services -- use your platform's secret manager (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Doppler, etc.). Do not commit `appsettings.Development.json` or `.env` files containing keys; the repo's `.gitignore` already excludes the common patterns, but the responsibility is on you.

## Running a sample

```bash
dotnet run --project samples/ch04-agent-framework/04.6.3-text-processing-walkthrough
```

Each sample folder has its own `README.md` with run instructions, expected output, and the manuscript section it backs.

## Building everything

```bash
dotnet build
```

builds the full `AI in .Net.sln` solution from the repo root.

## What's offline-runnable

These samples need **only** Ollama (no API keys, no cloud calls):

- `ch01/01.3-hello-chat` (default profile), `01.3-embeddings`, `01.4-secrets-and-config`
- `ch02/02.1-console-chat-loop`, `02.2-streaming-aspnet`, `02.4-middleware-pipeline`, `02.4-custom-middleware`
- `ch03/03.1-semantic-search`, `03.2-rag-basic`, `03.2-ingestion-pipeline`, `03.5-local-rag`
- `ch04/04.2.1-hello-agent`, `04.3-persistent-session`, `04.5-agent-middleware`, `04.7-a2a-server`
- `ch05/*` (all MCP samples; `05.4-mcp-client` needs a server to talk to)
- `ch06/06.1-observability`, `06.2.1-resilience`, `06.5.1-unit-testing`, `output-guard-chat-client`

The rest assume an OpenAI / Anthropic / Azure OpenAI key.

## Cost expectations

Cloud-provider samples spend real money against your account. Most are single-shot prompts that come in well under a cent at current OpenAI / Azure OpenAI / Anthropic pricing. The two exceptions worth flagging:

- `03.2-ingestion-pipeline` embeds a multi-document corpus -- expect a few cents per full ingestion run, depending on the embedding model.
- `06.5.3-llm-as-judge` and `03.2.7-evaluation` issue judge calls per evaluated response -- a 50-row golden set against a frontier model is typically tens of cents.

If you intend to run any sample unattended (CI, scheduled jobs, scripts), set per-key spend caps in your provider console first.

## Continuous integration

CI runs on every push and pull request, plus a weekly Monday build to catch transitive package drift. The matrix builds every sample in the `samples/` tree against the pinned versions in `Directory.Packages.props`. A green badge above means the print-tagged code still compiles end-to-end. If the badge is red, check the latest [Actions run](https://github.com/CodeShayk/generative-ai-dotnet-samples/actions/workflows/ci.yml) for the breaking package or API change before assuming the samples are wrong.

CI catches build-level drift but not all runtime regressions. For the model-ID surface that ships in Appendix B, run the live-API smoke harness at [`tests/AnthropicVerification/`](tests/AnthropicVerification/) -- it iterates each cited Claude model ID against the live Anthropic API and reports `PASS`/`FAIL` per model. Each verification pass is recorded in [`docs/verification-log.md`](docs/verification-log.md).

## Known issues

- **`Anthropic.SDK` 5.10 ↔ `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` 10.5 binding gap (mitigated).** `Anthropic.SDK` 5.10.0 is compiled against `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions` 10.3.0; the central pin is 10.5.0 (required by `Microsoft.Agents.AI` 1.3), which reshapes `HostedMcpServerTool.AuthorizationToken`. Calling Claude through Anthropic.SDK's bundled `IChatClient` bridge therefore throws `MissingMethodException` at runtime against the central pins. **Mitigation (2026-05-03):** `samples/ch04-agent-framework/04.2.4-anthropic-agents` ships a thin local adapter, `AnthropicChatClient.cs`, that calls `AnthropicClient.Messages.GetClaudeMessageAsync` directly and translates Anthropic ↔ M.E.AI types itself, bypassing the broken `ChatClientHelper`. The sample builds clean and runs end-to-end (two-turn live conversation confirmed against `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`). The throwaway harness at `tests/AnthropicVerification/` is unaffected -- it has no `Microsoft.Agents.AI` dependency and keeps a local `VersionOverride` to M.E.AI 10.3.0. **Cleanup:** once `Anthropic.SDK` 5.11+ ships rebuilt against M.E.AI 10.5+, delete `AnthropicChatClient.cs`, revert `Program.cs` to `IChatClient chat = new AnthropicClient(apiKey).Messages;`, drop the `VersionOverride` on the verification harness, and re-run both. Full chain in `docs/verification-log.md` (entries `2026-05-02` and `2026-05-03`).

## Versioning and tags

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `v1.0-first-print` | Code as it appears in the first print run of the book. |
| `v1.x-second-print` | Updated for any subsequent print revisions (placeholder; not yet cut). |
| `master` | Always-current; tracks latest stable .NET 9 + Microsoft.Extensions.AI. May drift from any specific print run. |

Use a **tag** in any URL you cite from the book -- never `master`.

## Contributing

Issues are welcome -- bugs, builds broken by transitive package drift, samples whose APIs have moved on, README mistakes. Pull requests are welcome too, especially:

- Build fixes for newer NuGet releases.
- README clarifications (per sample or repo-wide).
- New offline-runnable variants of samples that currently require cloud keys.

Before opening a PR: run `dotnet build` from the repo root and confirm the affected sample(s) still run. If you change observable behavior, update the sample's README.

## Errata

Open an issue at [github.com/CodeShayk/generative-ai-dotnet-samples](https://github.com/CodeShayk/generative-ai-dotnet-samples/issues). Confirmed errata roll into the next print tag and are noted in the parent book's errata page.
