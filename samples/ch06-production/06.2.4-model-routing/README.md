# Chapter 6.2.4 -- Cost-Aware Model Routing

Companion code for **Generative AI in .NET**, Chapter 6 section 6.2.4 ("Routing Simple Tasks to Cheaper Models").

A two-step pipeline: **classify** the query with `gpt-4o-mini`, then **route** it -- simple queries are answered by the cheap model, complex queries are escalated to `gpt-4o`. The book's economic case is that ~70% of typical traffic is "simple" and can be served at one-tenth the cost.
